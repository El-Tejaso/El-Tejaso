This github profile contains all of my personal projects.

Here are the most notable:

## Actively working on:

<details>
<summary>Powerslide (Unity3D, C#)</summary>

An arcade racing game that is the successor to [Racing Drift](https://gamejolt.com/games/RacingDrift/377289) that will actually be good when it's released
</details>

<details>
<summary><a href="https://github.com/El-Tejaso/CSharp-Minimal-Application-Framework">Minimal Application Framework</a> (C#, .net6, OpenGL) ⭐</summary>

An app development library with an API that is heavily inspired by Processing, but aims to be used for app development rather than creative programming or live coding.
</details>



## Completed:

<details>
<summary><a href="https://github.com/El-Tejaso/MacroRunner">Macro runner</a> (TypeScript, JavaScript, VS-Code Extension) ⭐</summary>

A [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=El-Tejaso.macro-runner) that uses some variant of JavaScript's `eval` function to arbitrary snippets of code on text files that are currently open. This project is by far the epitome of software engineering - taking two things that already exist, connecting them together to make something slightly better and then taking full credit for the final product. It is easily the most useful thing I have made so far. This readme was actually generated with a script ran by this extension. Writing a script for such a task is usually thought of as unnecessary, but this extension makes it so easy that you can't not write a script for it.

<details>
<summary><a href="https://github.com/El-Tejaso/Non-Grating-Timer">Non-Grating Timer</a> (C#, WinForms (Yep you read that right xD))</summary>

An extremely simple timer that alerts you in a way that is almost guaranteed to get your attention without startling/jump-scaring you or making you lose focus. The secret - no audio. Instead, the window starts bouncing around the screen, which is why I had to do this as a native application.
</details>

<details>
<summary><a href="https://github.com/El-Tejaso/Rust-journal">Rust journal</a> (Rust)</summary>

A simple journal program that allows you to log to a journal, which is just a folder that contains 1 text file per day of the year. I use it every day. Writing this program made allowed me to no-longer hate rust. It's actually a pretty good language, and much easier to work with and understand when you have a VSCode extension with type-inference, and cargo-watch running in a second monitor.
</details>



## Shelved, but I plan on coming back to it:

<details>
<summary><a href="https://github.com/El-Tejaso/EntityComponentSystem">EntityComponentSystem</a> (C#)</summary>

An attempt at writing a fast and understandable ECS implementation in C#. Probably a poor choice of language for this kind of thing but I like using it, and that is also kind of the point. I have not been able to make this particularly fast, but I plan on trying to use source generators for this later.
</details>

<details>
<summary><a href="https://github.com/El-Tejaso/SongTimingGenerator/blob/main/README.md">Song Timing Generator</a> (C#, WinForms (lmao), Digital signal processing)</summary>

A program created with the intent of generating 'multi-bpm timings' for rhythm game charts. This is actually quite hard to do, and I was not able to. Yet. But I do have some idea of what to try next
</details>



## No longer working on, hope someone else makes it / executes it better it so I don't have to:

<details>
<summary><a href="https://github.com/El-Tejaso/Harmonic-Table">Harmonic table</a> (Unity3D, C#, Music?) ⭐</summary>

A virtual musical instrument based on the harmonic table layout. Someone posted a very similar project to HackerNews, and I had a lot of fun playing with it. So I copied it into a Unity game and tried to recreate it, with the aim that it will also be able teach you how to play songs by converting MIDI files to notes that a user can see and then play. Turns out that this instrument is insanely hard to learn, and the relationships between different hexagons are not intuitive at all, so I didn't want to put any more time into it
</details>

<details>
<summary><a href="https://github.com/El-Tejaso/Sound-Painter">Sound painter</a> (Processing, Java, UI, Digital signal processing)</summary>

A processing sketch that lets you edit a snippet of sound with brushes. Sound is much more complex that I thought at the time, and this editor is super lacking in that regard. The UI looks pretty cool though
